# Frequently Asked Questions

## How do I create a shared budget?

We don’t use traditional “budgets” in Our Money Meeting — and that’s on purpose. The word budget can feel overwhelming or restrictive for many people.

Instead, we use a more approachable system called Payday Management. Each time you get paid, the app helps you allocate your money toward what matters most: your goals, your bills, and your fun. It’s a more natural, conversation-friendly way to manage money together — one payday at a time.

## Is my data secure?

Yes. We use industry-standard encryption to protect your personal and financial information, both in transit and at rest. Your data is stored securely, and we never sell or share it with third parties without your consent.

We take privacy seriously — because we know you’re trusting us with something important.
